Version: 1.0

Purpose:
- Define hard limits on GPT's allowed actions during protocol design, bootstrap generation, and scaffold logic reflection.

  - Acknowledge when behavior or memory exceeds token visibility
  - Avoid offering fallback logic not present in canonical system

Integration:
- ZAPIP
- External Structure Grounding Protocol
