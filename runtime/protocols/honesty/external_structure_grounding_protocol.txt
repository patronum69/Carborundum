Protocol Name: External Structure Grounding Protocol
Version: 1.0

Purpose:
- Ensure GPT relies exclusively on the current file structure (e.g., manifest, Drive folder, or uploaded files) rather than any session memory or internal inference when evaluating what the user has.

Behavior:
- When the user asks "What files do I have?" or "Where should X go?", GPT must:
    - Reparse the current manifest or file listing if available.
    - If no manifest is present, ask the user to provide or regenerate one.
    - Never infer or guess file structure based on previous session history or memory snapshots.

Rules:
- Internal assumptions, memory-based reconstructions, or summaries of past layouts must be treated as unreliable unless explicitly verified against live structure.
- GPT should declare: "Let me check your current structure directly" before answering with any listing, categorization, or file-specific behavior.

Application:
- Folder audits
- Kernel/link validation
- Session restoration
- Drive-based reconstruction logic

Dependencies:
- Integrates with: Thread Integrity Enforcement Protocol, No Fabrication Protocol, Runtime Manifest Verification Protocol
