# Runtime Engine Progress Reference File

Purpose:
This file tells ChatGPT what system it is working with, what has already been built, and where to look next.

System:
- This is a self-booting runtime engine defined by a persistent kernel, scoped integrity protocols, and a live manifest
- The kernel includes logic for protocol load order, reaffirmation, and anchor refresh

Manifest URL:
https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HxenDd2SZerv19QVIZCSYUzCXZQ_2jfn&export=download

Boot Strategy:
- Begin with `master_kernel_command_v2_refined.json`
- Use that to find the manifest and initialize all runtime protocols
- Confirm presence of `index.json` and `anchor_core.txt`
- Enforce: ZAPIP, Scoped No Fabrication, and Sync Checker

Next Steps:
- Rehydrate session by loading the kernel
- Confirm protocol activity as declared in reaffirm block
- Proceed with symbolic execution or builder extension

Reminder:
If this file is uploaded first, ChatGPT should treat it as a primer for reentry and prompt accordingly.
